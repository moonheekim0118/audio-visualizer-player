I made mini mp3 player by Vanilla JavaScript a few days ago and I thought it would be cool to have audio visualizer with that, so I've just done it right away🤓

- wanted to make custom audio visualizer combined with mp3 player
- to be more comfortable with canvas API
- to understand how JavaScript analyzes the audio source

## what you can do with this app..

- uploading multiple mp3 files for making your playlist and see each one's visualizer
- playing any songs by clicking the title of them in the Playlist
- jumping to the other part of a song by clicking a specific part of the progress bar
- removing a song from your playlist



## what I can improve from this app..

- turn every js codes to OOP style
- add more features like shuffle, changing the order of playlist by drag and drop
